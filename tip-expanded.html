                    <p>AMD has a brand new generation of Ryzen CPUs coming in 2019.
                            Based on a next-gen Zen 2 architecture, the 3rd generation AMD Ryzen processors should offer dramatic
                            performance improvements over its predecessor, the Ryzen 2000 series. Here’s everything you need to know
                            about AMD’s new chips.</p>
                <p>AMD initially claimed that the first samples of its Ryzen 3000 series CPUs would be available in late
                    2018, but CEO Lisa Su has since confirmed the range at CES 2019. That has now begun with the
                    unveiling of the Ryzen 3000 mobile CPUs (see below). The desktop processors, meanwhile, will still
                    be coming in mid-2019, according to AMD CEO Lisa Su.</p>

                <p>We initially got our first glimpse of this generation of technology in AMD’s Epyc Rome server CPUs in
                    early November, which gave us further hints about what kind of architecture we can expect in the
                    Ryzen 3000 range (see below). That doesn’t tell us much about the release date for Ryzen, but since
                    they are built on the same technology, it suggests that there shouldn’t be any supply issues causing
                    further delays.</p>

                <p>It’s not clear yet clear how long mid-2019 refers to, but YouTuber AdoredTV did release a supposedly
                    leaked chart of Ryzen information at the beginning of December. It suggested that following the
                    debut of most of the next-gen range at CES, there would be further chip reveals in May and Q3 2019.
                    That alleged leak also contained pricing information which painted the Ryzen 3000 series as being
                    comparable on the cost to the Ryzen 2000 series. Entry level CPUs would cost between $100 and $130,
                    with the mid-range stretching between $180 and $330. The absolute top of the line chips is said to
                    cost $450 and $500.</p>
