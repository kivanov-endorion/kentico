CHANGES:

Renamed .no-gutters to .g-0 to match new gutter utilities.
Columns no longer have position: relative applied
Dropped several .order-* classes that often went unused. We now only provide .order-1 to .order-5 out of the box.
Dropped the .media component as it can be easily replicated with utilities - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/utilities/flex/#media-object
Links are underlined by default
Dropped .text-justify class
.custom-check is now .form-check.
.custom-check.custom-switch is now .form-check.form-switch.
.custom-select is now .form-select.
.custom-file and .form-file have been replaced by custom styles on top of .form-control.
.custom-range is now .form-range.
Dropped native .form-control-file and .form-control-range.
Dropped .input-group-append and .input-group-prepend. You can now just add buttons and .input-group-text as direct children of the input groups.
Dropped form-specific layout classes for our grid system. Use our grid and utilities instead of .form-group, .form-row, or .form-inline.
Form labels now require .form-label.
Dropped all .badge-* color classes for background utilities (e.g., use .bg-primary instead of .badge-primary).
Dropped .badge-pill—use the .rounded-pill utility instead.
Dropped .btn-block for utilities. 
Replaced chevron icons for carousel controls with new SVGs from Bootstrap Icons.
Renamed .close to .btn-close for a less generic name.
Close buttons now use a background-image (embedded SVG) instead of a &times; in the HTML, allowing for easier customization without the need to touch your markup.
Renamed .left-* and .right-* to .start-* and .end-*.
Renamed .float-left and .float-right to .float-start and .float-end.
Renamed .border-left and .border-right to .border-start and .border-end.
Renamed .rounded-left and .rounded-right to .rounded-start and .rounded-end.
Renamed .ml-* and .mr-* to .ms-* and .me-*.
Renamed .pl-* and .pr-* to .ps-* and .pe-*.
Renamed .text-left and .text-right to .text-start and .text-end.
Disabled negative margins by default.
Renamed .text-monospace to .font-monospace.
Removed .text-hide
Renamed .font-weight-* utilities as .fw-* for brevity and consistency.
Renamed .font-style-* utilities as .fst-* for brevity and consistency.
Classes have been renamed to change by to x in the aspect ratio. For example, .ratio-16by9 is now .ratio-16x9.
We’ve dropped the .embed-responsive-item and element group selector in favor of a simpler .ratio > * selector. No more class is needed, and the ratio helper now works with any HTML element.
Renamed .sr-only and .sr-only-focusable to .visually-hidden and .visually-hidden-focusable
